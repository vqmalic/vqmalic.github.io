Hi, I'm Vincent Malic and I'm an Information Science PhD student at Indiana University, Bloomington. My broad research interests are machine learning, natural language processing, and network analysis. In particular, I focus on how these may be applied to humanities research. 

## What I'm up to

* Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to explore the thematic structure of the _Standard Histories_ (正史), a collection of documents which cover Chinese history from the mythological era to the end of the Ming Dynasty.

* Visualizing the internal representations of Convolutional Neural Networks trained on texts.

* Working with Bryant Paul, Yanyan Zhou, and Niki Fritz at the Media School on modelling aggression and behavior co-occurrence in pornography.
